# create-link-to-git-server README

Easily share a link to VSC website of a line of your code: right click on a line in an editor, an click the item "Get link to this line". 

Some may argue that gitLens is already doing this, but to be precise, there are two main differences: 
- gitLens doesn't work with private/custom it servers. 
- gitlens links to commits, while this extension links to remotes/branches.
